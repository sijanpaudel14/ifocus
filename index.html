                go ahead and do it. Put your dream across, and never mind what ‘they’ say if you meet with temporary

                success.”

                “You may have been disappointed, you may have suffered setbacks and defeat during hard economic
                times, you may have felt the great heart within you crushed until it bled. Take courage, for these
                experiences have tempered the spiritual metal of which you are made—they are assets of incomparable
                value.
                Go into some quiet spot (preferably in bed at night) where you will not be disturbed or interrupted,
                close your eyes, and repeat aloud (so you may hear your own words) the written statement of the
                amount of money you intend to accumulate, the time limit for its accumulation, and a description of
                the service or merchandise you intend to give in return for the money.”

            <section class="sectionSubTag text-small">While our sensory receptors are constantly collecting
                information from the environment, it is ultimately how we interpret that information that affects
                how we interact with the world. Perception refers to the way sensory information is organized,
                interpreted, and consciously experienced. Perception involves both bottom-up and top-down
                processing. Bottom-up processing refers to the fact that perceptions are built from sensory input.
                On the other hand, how we interpret those sensations is influenced by our available knowledge, our
                experiences, and our thoughts. This is called top-down processing.
                Although our perceptions are built from sensations, not all sensations result in perception. In
                fact, we often don’t perceive stimuli that remain relatively constant over prolonged periods of
                time. This is known as sensory adaptation. Imagine entering a classroom with an old analog clock.
                Upon first entering the room, you can hear the ticking of the clock; as you begin to engage in
                conversation with classmates or listen to your professor greet the class, you are no longer aware of
                the ticking. The clock is still ticking, and that information is still affecting sensory receptors
                of the auditory system. The fact that you no longer perceive the sound demonstrates sensory
                adaptation and shows that while closely associated, sensation and perception are different.

                be strong and don’t give the chance to anyone to make you feel weak.
                Life isn’t about what I’ve done, what I should have done, what I could have done. It’s about what I can

                Negativity breeds negative thinking, actions and being. Let go of negativity in your life and become the

                In order to take a positive action, we must develop a positive vision.

                Success is never achieved by the size of our brain, but it is always achieved by the quality of our
                thoughts.<br>
                Never stop dreaming. Yesterday’s dream can become the reality of tomorrow, and the innovation of the
                future.
